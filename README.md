# Mezon Documentation

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (73).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Welcome to Mezon Documentation!

**Mezon** is an all-in-one **Live – Work – Play** platform where you can chat, work, study, and have fun — all within one seamless space.\
More than just a communication app, Mezon is a connected ecosystem that empowers you to **connect, create, and grow communities** - naturally, smoothly, and completely free.

***

#### **Chat & Connect**

Mezon provides everything you need for smooth, friendly, and secure communication:

* Personal and group messaging with text, images, videos, and files.
* Voice and video calls with easy screen sharing.
* Add friends, create groups, and manage your contacts — just like any popular messenger, but smoother, safer, and with no device or storage limits.

See more: [**Friends & Messaging**](broken-reference)

***

#### **Clan – Community & Workspace**

If direct messaging is where you connect one-on-one, **Clans** are where you connect with many — for collaboration, learning, or community building.\
A Clan can be a **community, study group, or organization workspace**, giving you the structure and tools to communicate and work together effectively.

* Create and manage multiple topic-based Channels for easy organization and focused discussions.
* Use Voice Channels as meeting rooms, classrooms, or open conversation spaces.
* Host events, discussions, and file sharing directly within your Clan.
* Customize permissions, roles, and appearance to make your Clan operate like a true professional workspace.

***

#### **Bots, Apps & AI – Expand Your Experience**

The Bots and Apps system helps you personalize Mezon and unlock more possibilities:

* **Bots:** Automate tasks, support your work, or bring fun games to your Clan.
* **Apps:** Access web applications directly within Mezon – no installation or extra login needed.
* **AI Agent:** Your smart assistant that can summarize information, send emails, or support online tasks.
