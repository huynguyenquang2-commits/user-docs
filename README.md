### Welcome to the Mezon Documentation!

**Mezon** is an all-in-one **Live – Work – Play** platform, where you can chat, work, study, and have fun — all in one seamless space.

More than just a messaging app, Mezon is a **complete ecosystem** that helps you connect, create, and grow your community naturally, smoothly, and completely free of charge.

### **Chat and Connect**

Mezon provides everything you need for smooth, friendly communication:

* **Private and group messaging** with support for photos, videos, and files.
* **Voice and video calls**, plus easy **screen sharing**.
* **Add friends, create groups, and manage contacts** — similar to popular messaging apps, but faster, safer, and with no limits on devices or storage.

### **Clan – Community and Workspace**

If direct messages are where you connect one-on-one, then **Clans** are where you connect with many — for many purposes.\
A Clan can be a **community**, a **study group**, or a **workspace**.

* Create and manage multiple **channels** by topic for organized discussions.
* Use **voice channels** as meeting rooms, classrooms, or open chat spaces.
* Host **events, discussions**, and **share files and information** right within the Clan.
* Customize **roles, permissions, and appearance** to make your Clan operate like a true professional workspace.

### **Bots, Apps & AI – Expand Your Experience**

The **Bot and App ecosystem** lets you personalize Mezon and extend its capabilities:

* **Bots:** Automate actions, support tasks, or create fun interactive games.
* **Apps:** Run web applications directly within Mezon — no installation or extra login needed.
* **AI Agents:** Intelligent assistants that can summarize information, send emails, or assist with your work online.
