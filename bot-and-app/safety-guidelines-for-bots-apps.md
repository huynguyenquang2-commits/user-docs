# Safety Guidelines for Bots/Apps

### **Use Trusted Sources Only**

Add Bots/Apps from [**top.mezon.ai** ](https://top.mezon.ai/)or other sources that are verified and highly rated by the Mezon community. Avoid unclear or unverified sources.

### **Check Permissions Carefully**

Before granting access, read and understand the permissions the Bot/App requests. **Never grant Administrator permissions unless absolutely necessary.**

### **Limit Access Rights**

Only provide the minimum permissions required for the Bot/App to function. This helps protect your Clanâ€™s data and ensures overall security.
