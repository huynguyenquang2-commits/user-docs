# What is a Bot?

Bots on Mezon are more than just automation tools — they’re an open platform where you can **create, customize, and connect anything** with just a few clicks.

From managing Clans and integrating external apps to building AI **Agents powered by LLMs,** everything can be done right inside Mezon.

With Bots, you can:

* Automate tasks and save time.
* Connect and control external applications.
* Manage your Clan like a real organization.
* Build games, AI assistants, or any tool you can imagine.

**All it takes is an idea and your Bot will bring it to life.**\
You can find detailed guides on how to create and integrate Bots in the [**Mezon Developer Docs**](https://mezon.ai/docs/mezon-sdk-docs/), and explore community-made Bots in [**Mezon Discover**](https://top.mezon.ai/)

### **Use Cases & Real Examples of Mezon Bots**

#### **1. Clan Management & Coordination Support**

Bots help you monitor, control, and interact with Clan members automatically.\
A prime example is **KOMU Bot**, used by Mezon to manage over **350 remote employees**. KOMU can:

* Track online status and remind users if they don’t respond.

* Automatically create meeting rooms with the `*meeting now` command.

* Record daily check-ins and check-outs.

### **2. Workflow Automation**

KOMU Bot also automates various daily company tasks:

* Sends birthday greetings to employees.

* Reminds users about duties or recurring reports.

* Even turns on office computers remotely with the `*wol` command.

All with a single command in Mezon — no extra apps or complex interfaces needed.

### **3. Integration with External Software**

Mezon Bots can connect to business systems and apps like Trello, Jira, CRMs, or any platform with an open API.

This allows you to:

* Create tasks, update statuses, or view reports directly in Mezon.
* Automatically sync data between Mezon and external platforms.
* Avoid switching between multiple tools all day.

### **4. Gaming Bots – Entertainment within Mezon**

Bots aren’t just for work — they can also power fun and community-driven experiences.

Example: **Ainz Bot**, a mini RPG where players can:

* Hunt, collect, and train virtual creatures.
* Duel other players to level up and earn rare items.
* Build leaderboards and dedicated player Clans.

### **5. Intelligent Assistants – AI Agents on Mezon**

Thanks to LLM (Large Language Model) integration, Mezon Bots can act as real AI Agents working on your behalf.

**Example 1: Email Management Bot**\
This Bot can access your email and Mezon account to:

* Summarize new emails every morning.
* Display reports and key info directly in Mezon.
* Let you reply in Mezon — and it sends real emails for you.

**Example 2: Chat Monitoring & Summarization Bot**\
With **Shadow mode**, the Bot can read the content of channels you’re part of and:

* Automatically summarize key messages.
* Send daily digests or highlight mentions of you.
* Keep you updated without reading every message.

Bots on Mezon aren’t just “add-ons” — they’re **the core that expands Mezon’s power**.\
From management and automation to enterprise integration and AI ecosystems,\
**there are no limits to what Bots can do.**
