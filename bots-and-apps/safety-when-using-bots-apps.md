# Safety When Using Bots/Apps

### **1. Use Trusted Sources Only**

* Always add Bots or Apps from [**top.mezon.ai**](https://top.mezon.ai/) or other sources **verified and recommended by the Mezon community.**
* Avoid installing from unknown or unverified origins.

### **2. Review Permissions Carefully**

* Before granting access, make sure to **read and understand** the permissions requested by the Bot/App.
* Never grant **Administrator access** unless it’s absolutely necessary.

### **3. Limit Access Rights**

* Only provide the **minimum permissions** needed for the Bot/App to function properly.
* This helps keep your Clan’s data and information secure.
