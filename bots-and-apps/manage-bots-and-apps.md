# Manage Bots & Apps

### **View & Adjust**

Go to the **Members** section in your Clan.\
Here, youâ€™ll find a complete list of all active Bots and Apps.

### **Customize Permissions & Roles**

Just like regular members, Bots and Apps can be assigned specific **roles and permissions**.\
This lets you control exactly what actions they can perform within your Clan.\
See the guide on [Managing Roles and Permissions](../clan/create-your-own-clan/manage-your-clan/clan-settings/permissions-and-roles-management.md)
