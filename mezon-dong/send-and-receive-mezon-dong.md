# Send & Receive Mezon Dong

### **1. Check Your Mezon Wallet Balance**

Your Mezon Dong balance is always displayed directly in your **Mezon account profile**.

Here you’ll find:

* **Balance:** your current amount (displayed in VND).
* **Transfer:** send tokens to another user.
* **Transaction history:** review past transfers and receipts.

### **2. Transfer Mezon Dong Instantly**

When selecting **Transfer**, a send window will appear:

* **Recipient:** enter the username or ID of the person you want to send to.
* **Amount:** specify the amount of Mezon Dong to send (shown in VND).
* **Note:** add a short message (e.g., “coffee money,” “lunch payment”).
* Tap **Transfer** to complete the transaction.

All Mezon Dong transfers are **instant, free of charge**, and require **no intermediaries** — transactions finalize within seconds.
{% endhint %}

### **3. Give a Coffee (Optional)**

If you’d like to send a small, symbolic gift, use the **“Give a Coffee”** feature (1 Coffee = **10,000 MEZ**).\
It’s a fun and friendly way to say _thanks_ or _cheer someone up_ within your Clan.

With these options, **Mezon Dong becomes a simple, friendly financial connector** — from internal payments to small daily gestures of appreciation.
