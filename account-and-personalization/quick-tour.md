The Mezon mobile interface is designed for you to connect, chat, and manage communities anytime, anywhere.\
Here are the 6 main areas you’ll use most often:

### **1. Mezon Logo**

* This is where all your personal messages and friend lists are gathered.
* Simply tap the logo to view all your private conversations and easily start a new message.

You can even **customize the Mezon logo** with your own image in _Personalization Settings_.
{% endhint %}

### **2. Clan List**

* The vertical bar on the left displays all the Clans you’ve joined.
* Each icon represents a Clan — just tap to quickly switch between different communities.

Learn more about Clans in [_What is a Clan_](../clan/what-is-a-clan.md)_?_

### **3. Clan Home**

When you select a Clan, you’ll see its cover image, name, member count, and a short description of the community.\
Here, you can:

* View Clan information
* Search for channels, topics, or members
* Scan QR codes to trade tokens or join another Clan
* View the Clan’s event calendar

### **4. Clan Navigation**

* When you open a Clan, this section displays all active Categories, Channels, and Topics inside it.
* There are 3 types of channels:
  * [**Text Channel**](../clan/create-your-own-clan/manage-your-clan/clan-structure/channels-in-a-clan/text-channel/)
  * [**Voice Channel**](../clan/create-your-own-clan/manage-your-clan/clan-structure/channels-in-a-clan/voice-channel.md)
  * [**Stream Channel**](../clan/create-your-own-clan/manage-your-clan/clan-structure/channels-in-a-clan/stream-channel.md)
* This is where you navigate between different channels within a Clan.

### **5. Create a New Clan**

* If you want to start your own group, tap the **“+”** button at the bottom of the Clan list.
* You can name your Clan, create private channels, add friends, and start building your own community.

### **6. Bottom Navigation Bar**

This is where you quickly move between the main sections:

* **Clans:** List of all your communities
* **Messages:** 1-on-1 or small group chats
* **Inbox:** Latest updates and notifications
* **Profile:** Manage personal information and settings
