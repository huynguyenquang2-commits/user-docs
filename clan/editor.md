# What is Clan?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A **Clan** is the heart of Mezon — where people connect, collaborate, and share through communities built around shared **interests, goals, or passions**.

While private chats help you connect **one-on-one**, Clans open the door to **a world of collective interaction**.\
A Clan can be a **small group of friends** or a **large-scale community** with thousands of members — a digital “square” where everyone can chat, work, and create together.

Within a Clan, you can:

* **Chat, share ideas, and discuss by topic** through organized Channels.
* **Host events, meetings, or open talks** with hundreds of participants via Voice Channels.
* **Learn, work, play, or simply chill** with your friends.
* **Enhance your Clan** using Bots, Apps, and Mezon Tokens to create a richer and more dynamic community experience.

Whether you’re a **creator**, a **business**, or simply someone looking for a cozy digital space for your friends — your Clan is your **second home** on Mezon.
