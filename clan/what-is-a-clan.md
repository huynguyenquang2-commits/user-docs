# What is a Clan?

A **Clan** is **the heart of Mezon** — where people connect, work, and share through communities of all sizes built around shared interests, goals, or passions.&#x20;

While personal chats help you connect one-on-one, a Clan lets you **engage with an entire world.**

A Clan can be a small group of a few members or a large space with thousands — like a virtual “square” where everyone can chat, collaborate, and create together.

In a Clan, you can:

* Exchange ideas and chat by **topic or in dedicated channels.**
* **Host events**, meetings, or open talks with hundreds of participants via Voice Channels.
* Study, work, play, or simply chill with friends.
* Use **Bots, Apps, and Mezon Dong** to enhance functionality and create richer community experiences.

Whether you’re a content creator, a business, or just want a cozy space for friends — your Clan is your **second home on Mezon**.
