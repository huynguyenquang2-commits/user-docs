# Manage Your Clan

Here you’ll find detailed guidance for key management features:

* [**Clan Settings:**](clan-settings/) Manage the Clan’s name, icon, integrations, and permissions.
* [**Clan Structure:**](clan-structure/) Arrange **Categories** and **Channels** to keep things tidy and intuitive.
* [**Events Management**](creating-and-managing-events.md)**:** Schedule and host meetings, workshops, or community activities right within your Clan.
* [**Notifications**](clan-structure/channels-in-a-clan/text-channel/notification-settings.md)**:** Customize how announcements and alerts are sent or received across different channels or member groups.

With Mezon’s flexible management tools, you can run your Clan efficiently, maintain a positive environment, and scale smoothly as your community grows.
