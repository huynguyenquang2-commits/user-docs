* **Voice Channel:** Host the event directly in an existing Clan voice channel, leveraging Mezonâ€™s voice, video, and screen sharing features.
* **Audience Settings:**
  * **No channel selected:** The event becomes a **Clan Event**, visible and open to all Clan members.
  * **Channel selected:** The event becomes a **Channel Event**, only visible to members of the chosen channel.
* **Other Locations:** For real-life events or on other platforms, you can add a link or address so participants can easily follow and join.
* **Private Event:** Create an online meeting room that anyone can join â€” even users without a Mezon account. No login required, just click the link to join. Fully free, no time limits, with full features: voice, video, chat, and screen sharing.

3. Enter event details and click **Next**.
