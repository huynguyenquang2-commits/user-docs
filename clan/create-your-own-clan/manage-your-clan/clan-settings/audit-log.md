# Audit Log

It’s especially useful when your Clan grows larger and has multiple admins — helping you review activity history or investigate issues when needed.

You can easily filter the log to find specific records by:

* **Time:** View actions performed within a specific date range.
* **User:** See activities made by a particular member or admin.
* **Action:** Filter by specific types of actions (e.g., edits, deletions, role updates).
