# Permissions & Roles Management

### 1. Permissions Management

As the community grows, the number of members and interactions increases. Without proper control, issues such as spam, accidental deletion of important content, or unwanted channel edits may occur, affecting the overall experience.

#### **1.1. Available Permissions**

* **Administrator** – Full control over the Clan (just below the owner).
* **Manage Clan** – Allows members to control clan settings, roles, and channels, monitor member activity, and ensure organized management.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
However, **Manage Clan** permission <mark style="color:red;">**cannot see/manage all channels like Administrator.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

* **Manage Channel** – Create, edit, or delete channels.
* **Manage Thread** – Create, edit, or delete threads within channels, including private threads.
* **Send Message** – Send messages in public channels (including threads and short discussions).
* **Delete Message** – Delete messages in public channels (including threads and short discussions).
* **View Channel** – View public channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**Clan Hierarchy**

* **Owner** – Highest authority; **can perform all actions**. Cannot be removed. Can transfer ownership to others. Has absolute control over members, roles, channels, and settings.
* **Administrator** – Just below the owner, **almost full control of the Clan**. Can manage channels, roles, members, and most settings. Can remove other admins or regular members, but cannot remove the owner.
{% endhint %}

#### **1.2. Setting Default Permissions**

1. Go to **Clan Settings → Roles**.
2. Select **@everyone** to set default permissions for all members.

3. Enable or disable basic actions members are allowed to perform.\

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Recommended:_ Only enable **View Channel** and **Send Message** to maintain order and safety.
{% endhint %}

4. Click **Save Changes** to apply permissions to all members.

### 2. Roles Management

Not all members need the same permissions. Roles let you create multiple groups with custom colors, icons, and detailed permissions. This helps the Clan operate professionally and scale as the community grows.

#### **2.1. Creating a New Role**

1. Go to **Clan Settings → Roles**.
2. Click the **“+”** icon to create a new role.

3. Set a name, permissions, and assign members.
4. Click **Save** to finish.

#### **2.2. Managing Existing Roles**

*   Tap a role to:

    * **Edit Display**: Change name, color, icon.
    * **Edit Permissions**: Enable/disable actions like sending messages, deleting messages, managing channels.
    * **Manage Members**: Add or remove members from the role.
    * **Delete Role**: Remove roles that are no longer needed.

### 3. Permission Overrides

Permission overrides allow you to set special permissions for **private channels or threads.** Only members with the assigned role or explicitly added users can see them.

#### **Customizing Permissions in Private Channels/Threads**

1. Press and hold the private channel/thread you want to edit.
2. Select **Edit Channel**.
3. Go to **Channel Permissions**.
4. Two sections appear:
   * **Basic:** Add roles or members to the private channel/thread.
   *   **Advanced:** List all members in the channel/thread. Customize permissions for each member individually:

       * Allow or block viewing the channel.
       * Allow or block sending messages.
       * Allow or block managing threads, deleting messages, etc.

5. Click **Save Changes** to apply.

{% hint style="success" %}
This feature allows flexible management—for example, a regular member can only read content in a private channel, while an assistant admin can read and send messages.
