# Clan Structure

In this section, you’ll learn how to build and manage your Clan structure:

* [**Channels** ](channels-in-a-clan/)– The main spaces for communication and collaboration, available in different types: **Text Channels**, **Voice Channels**, and **Stream Channels**, each serving specific purposes.
* [**Categories** ](clan-category.md)– Groups of related channels organized by topic.

A well-organized Clan structure not only helps members easily find the content they care about but also improves communication efficiency and strengthens community engagement.
