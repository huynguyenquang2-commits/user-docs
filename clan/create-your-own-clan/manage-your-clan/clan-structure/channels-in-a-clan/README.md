# Channels in a Clan

### **How to Create a Channel**

There are 3 types of Channels, each serving a different purpose:

* [**Text Channel**](text-channel/): The main space for Clan communication. Send text messages, images, videos, and store important information.
* [**Voice Channel**](voice-channel.md): Talk via voice, share your screen, or make video calls. All free, with no time or resolution limits!
* [**Stream Channel**](stream-channel.md): For Clan owners to host broadcasts, talk shows, or recurring podcasts.&#x20;

> You can enable **Private Channel** mode so that only selected members can see it.

Each Clan can have up to **500 Channels** at the same time.

### **Channel Settings**

* By default, channel permissions are synced with the permissions of the category it belongs to.
* Enable **Private Channel** to customize permissions specifically for that channel.

Permissions apply only to **Text** and **Voice Channels**. **Stream Channels** are always public for all Clan members.
