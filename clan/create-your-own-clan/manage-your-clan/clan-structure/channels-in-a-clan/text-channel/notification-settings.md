* **Mute Channel:** Completely silence notifications from the channel for a set period, such as 15 minutes, 1 hour, or until you manually turn it back on.
* **Use Default Settings:** Apply the same notification settings as the channel’s Category.
* **All:** Receive all notifications.
* **Mentions Only (@mention):** Get notified only when someone mentions you.
* **Nothing:** Turn off all notifications.

**Tip:** If you belong to multiple channels, keep most on **Mentions Only**. This way, you won’t miss important updates but also won’t be constantly interrupted.
