  Instead of mixing important documents within chat messages, Mezon provides a
  visual "notes board" directly in the channel.

# Canvas

### **How to use**

1. Open Mezon and select the Text Channel or Thread you want to work in.
2. Tap **Canvas** in the menu.

<figure><img src="../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (96).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Here, you can create a new Canvas and view the list of existing boards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Maximum image file size in a Canvas: 50 MB.
{% endhint %}

With the Canvas, all members can update content in real time. Data is stored centrally, preventing it from getting “lost” in conversations, helping your team save time and quickly access important information.
