# Manage Clan

Here’s what you can do as a Clan manager:

* **General Settings:** Manage the Clan’s name, avatar, integrations, and member permissions.
* **Clan Structure:** Create and organize **Categories** and **Channels** to keep everything neat and easy to navigate.
* **Events Management:** Schedule and host meetings, workshops, or community activities directly within your Clan.
* **Notifications:** Customize how announcements and updates are sent to different channels or member groups so no one misses important info.

With Mezon’s flexible management tools, running your Clan is simple, professional, and scalable as your community grows.
