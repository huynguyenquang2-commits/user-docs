# Managing Notifications in a Clan

### **How to Manage Clan Notifications:**

1. Right-click on the **Clan icon**.
2. Select **Notification Settings**.
3. Choose your preferred option:
   * **All** → Receive all messages.
   * **Only @mention** → Only receive notifications when someone mentions you.
   * **Nothing** → Turn off notifications completely.
   * **Use category default** → Follow the default notification settings of the channel group.
4. Alternatively, use **Mute Channel** to temporarily pause notifications for **15 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours**, or until you turn them back on.

If you’re in multiple Clans, set most to **Only @mention**. This way, you won’t miss important updates, yet avoid constant “ding” notifications all day.

Additionally, you can manage detailed notification settings for each Channel within a Clan by clicking the Clan name and selecting **Notification Settings**.

**Notification Badge:** On the Taskbar, you can quickly check notification status through the Mezon icon:

* <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">**Only Mezon Logo:** No new notifications.
* <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">**Red Dot next to the Mezon Logo:** You have new notifications.
* <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (156).png" alt="" data-size="line">**Number next to the Mezon Logo:** Someone mentioned you — the number indicates how many mentions you’ve received.
{% endhint %}
