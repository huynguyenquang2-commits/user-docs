# Enable Community

When you enable **Community Mode**, your Clan is no longer just a private group—it becomes a more accessible and open community.

* Your Clan will have a **custom fixed link** (e.g., mezon.ai/clan/clan-name), easy to remember and share.
* Your Clan will be visible on the **Discover** page, where Mezon users can search, view information, and join.
* You’ll gain **community management tools** to attract new members, organize events, and develop your Clan into a professional open space.

If you want your Clan to become a “branded” community, widely recognized and able to attract new members easily, enable **Community Mode** today.

### **How to Enable and Set Up a Mezon Community**
