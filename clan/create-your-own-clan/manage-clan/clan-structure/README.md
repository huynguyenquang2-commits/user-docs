# Clan Structure

In this section, you’ll learn how to build and manage your Clan’s structure:

* **Channels** – The main spaces for communication and collaboration. Channels come in various types, such as **Text Channels**, **Voice Channels**, and **Live Channels**, each serving different purposes.
* **Categories** – Groups of related channels organized by topic. You can create, reorder (**Category Order**), or hide/show categories based on your Clan’s needs.

A well-organized Clan structure not only makes it easier for members to find the content they care about but also improves communication efficiency and strengthens community engagement.
