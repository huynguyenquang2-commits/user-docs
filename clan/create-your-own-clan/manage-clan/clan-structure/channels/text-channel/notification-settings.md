# Notification Settings

### **How to Customize Notifications:**

* **Mute Channel** – Completely mute notifications from the channel for a chosen period (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour) or until you decide to unmute.
* **Use Category Default** – Apply the same notification settings as the channel’s category.
* **All** – Receive notifications for all messages.
* **Only** **@mention** – Receive notifications only when someone mentions you.
* **Nothing** – Turn off notifications completely.

**Tip:** If you are in multiple channels, keep most of them on **Only @mention**. This way, you won’t miss important messages while avoiding constant notification sounds.
{% endhint %}
