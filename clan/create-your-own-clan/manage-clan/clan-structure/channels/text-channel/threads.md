  individual members.

# Threads

### **How to Use Threads:**

1. Open Mezon and select the **Text Channel** where you want to communicate.
2. Click the **thread icon** <img src="../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the chat toolbar.
3. Select **Create** to start a new thread.
4. Enter the **thread name** and send the first message to begin the discussion with the group.

* To make a thread **private** (visible only to invited members and managers), select **Private Thread** at the bottom.
