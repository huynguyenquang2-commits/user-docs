# Join & Explore Clans

### **How to Join a Clan**

You can discover new Clans in two ways:

1. Through the **Discover** button <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (111).png" alt="" data-size="line"> within the app or directly via the [**Clans Website**](https://mezon.ai/clans/), where you can explore the most active communities on Mezon.
2. Via an **invite link** shared by friends, teammates, or admins.

Simply click **“Join”** to officially become part of that community.

Check out some of Mezon’s featured Clans:
