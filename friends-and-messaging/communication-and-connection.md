*   Tapping on the name of your friend or the group chat name on your phone allows you to:

    * Search messages within the conversation.
    * Adjust notification settings for the chat.
    * View the member list (in group chats, all members can add new people, but only the group admin has permission to remove members).
    * See shared media, including photos and videos.
    * View files sent in the conversation.
    * See pinned messages to easily keep track of important content.

*   **Buzz Mode**

    Tap the three dots in the top-right corner of the chat window, then type your message to send a vibrating notification. This helps grab everyone's attention in the conversation—even if they have their notifications turned off.
